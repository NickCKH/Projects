A **Generative Adversarial Network** consists of two contesting Neural Networks in the form of a zero-sum game, where one agent's gain is another agent's loss.
- Generator 
- Discriminator

The core idea that rules GANs is based on the “indirect” training through the Discriminator that is also getting updated dynamically. This basically means that the generator is not trained to minimize the distance to a specific image, but rather to fool the discriminator. This enables the model to learn in an unsupervised manner.
