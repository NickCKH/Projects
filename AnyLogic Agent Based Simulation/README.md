## Agent Based Simulation 

![AnyLogic Versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/AnyLogicProfessional-8.5.2+-blue.svg)

ABS is a field I'm highly interested in due to my background as a financial modeller. Coincidentally its popularity is highly correlated with the rise of Reinforcement Learning, so yay me because I love both. 

### Port of Hong Kong 

I've shown below some snippets of a recent project of mine concerning vessel and barge movements at terminals in the port of Hong Kong. 
AnyLogic is a powerful ABS software with an extensive library which includes: 
- Rail modelling 
- Traffic modelling 
- Process modelling 
- Fluids modelling 
- Many more

The ABS of an environment, sometimes called a Digital Twin, enables users to plan what-if scenarios in time-and-space, something traditional modelling techniques would not be able to accomplish. Depending on the fidelity of the Digital Twin, users can draw insights by tweaking assumptions and observing their impact on other agents in the environment, and the environment itself. 

Here's some samples of the Digital Twin of the Port of Hong Kong I've built, enjoy:
